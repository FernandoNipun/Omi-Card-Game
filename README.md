# Omi-Card-Game - A Unity Mobile Game Preview

Welcome to a sneak peek of my Unity mobile game, Omi Card Game!

While it's currently operational in offline mode only, it boasts the exciting feature of computer opponents. I've meticulously crafted algorithms for these player bots to make strategic decisions and play their best cards.

I've put my heart and soul into this project, handling everything from art and coding to crafting the perfect sound effects. Every element of this game is a result of my personal dedication and effort.
